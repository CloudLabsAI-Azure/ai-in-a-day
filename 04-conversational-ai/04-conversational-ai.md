# Lab 3 - Conversational AI with Azure Bot Service and Cognitive Services

This lab covers Power Virtual Agents as the hero bot service and demonstrates how to extend your PVA bot using Bot Framework Composer.

## Task 1 - Explore dashboard of COVID-19 data

Understanding the source datasets is very important in AI and ML. To help you expedite the process, we have created a Power BI dashboard you can use to explore them at the beginning of each lab.

![Azure AI in a Day datasets](./media/SHC1.png)

To get more details about the source datasets, check out the [Data Overview](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/ai-in-a-day/blob/main/data-overview.md) section.

To explore the dashboard of COVID-19 data, open the `Azure-AI-in-a-Day-Data-Overview` file located on the desktop (**C:\Users\public\desktop**) ðŸ’» of the virtual machine provided with your environment. If you see `Introducing the updated mobile layout` popup screen, then close it by click on `Got it`. Collapse the **Fields** and **Visualizations** tabs to see the clear report.

> **Note:** Please close and reopen the Power BI Desktop document if it throws an error in the first attempt.

## Task 2 - Explore lab scenario

The power of Machine Learning also comes into play when dealing with human-to-machine interfaces. While classical interfaces like native or web applications are ubiquitous, the new approaches based on conversational AI are becoming increasingly popular. Having the capability to interact with intelligent services using natural language is quickly becoming the norm rather than the exception. Using Conversational AI, analysts can find the research of interest by using simple natural language phrases.

With Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), Human Machine Interface (HMI) technologies are enjoying an increased adoption year over year. By 2021, [the growth of chatbots in this space is expected to be 25.07%](https://www.technavio.com/report/chatbot-market-industry-analysis).


The way organizations are building conversational systems is evolving, with bots being built and maintained by a mix of technical and non-technical roles. Power Virtual Agents has the capability to extend its capabilities by allowing pro-code users to create dialogs / topics using the Azure Bot Framework Composer today. This experience allows technical and non-technical teams to build and host their solutions on a single platform.

   ![](media/PVA-new-topic.png)

2. Name the topic as **Meal delivery options**, and on the **Trigger phrases** pane, add the following trigger phrases: 

   ```
   what meals can I order
   ```
   ```
   what meal options do you have
   ```
   ```
   what dishes do you deliver
   ```
   ```
   entrees available for delivery
   ```

   ![](media/trigger-phrases-1.png)


3. Delete the blank message node under the trigger phrases on the authoring canvas.

   ![](media/delete-01.png)

   ![](media/add-a-question.png)

5. On the **Question** node, add the following details:

      - **Ask a question**: ```What city are you in?```
      - **Identify**: ```City```
      - **Save Response as**: On the **Variable properties** tab that opens up, set the name of the variable as ```user_city``` and **usage** as **Bot (Any topic can access)**

   ![](media/add-a-question-1.png)

   >**Note**: The variable just created will be used in the adaptive card. For the variable to be used within Bot Framework Composer, it must be set with Bot scope rather than Topic scope.

6. Save the **topic**, then return to the list of topics. 

   ![](media/save-bot.png)

7. Select **Topics** from the left menu, then click on the downward arrow and select **Open in Bot Framework Composer**.

    ![](media/bot-composer-1.png)

    >**Note**: If you canâ€™t launch composer automatically from Power Virtual Agents, you can launch it manually from your browser. Click on Copy link to copy the link and paste the URL in your web browser.

8. Make sure to open Bot Framework Composer from within Power Virtual Agents. This ensures that Composer has all the necessary plugins needed for integration with Power Virtual Agents.

## Task 5 - Create an adaptive card using Bot Framework Composer

1. When Bot Framework Composer application launches, you will be prompted to sign in. Sign in with the provided credentials.

   >**Note**: You can find the credentials in the environment details tab.

2. Once you sign in, you will be asked to import your bot to a new project. The **Name** field will be auto-populated. If it's empty, fill the name field with the name of your bot **AI-Bot-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** which you created on the **Power virtual agents** page. Then, click **Create**.

   ![](media/import-bot.png)

   >**Note**: In the occasion where the following screen does not appear in Composer on launch, you will need to close the application and launch it again from Power Virtual Agents.
