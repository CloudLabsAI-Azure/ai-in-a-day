# Lab 1 - Azure Machine Learning Model Training

This lab covers clustering with Azure Machine Learning, Automated ML, and model explainability.

## Task 1 - Explore dashboard of COVID-19 data

Understanding the source datasets is very important in AI and ML. To help you expedite the process, we have created a Power BI dashboard you can use to explore them at the beginning of each lab.

![Azure AI in a Day datasets](../media/data-overview-01-01.png)

To get more details about the source datasets, check out the [Data Overview](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/ai-in-a-day/blob/main/data-overview.md) section.

To explore the dashboard of COVID-19 data, open the `Azure-AI-in-a-Day-Data-Overview` file located on the desktop (**C:\Users\public\desktop**) ðŸ’» of the virtual machine provided with your environment. If you see `Introducing the updated mobile layout` pop-up screen, then close it by click on `Got it`. Collapse the **Fields** and **Visualizations** tabs to see the clear report.

> **Note:** Please close and reopen the Power BI Desktop document if it throws an error in the first attempt.

## Task 2 - Explore lab scenario

Given the magnitude of the COVID-19 problem, it comes naturally to have a lot of research on the topic. In fact, in 2020 alone, tens of thousands of papers have been published on COVID-19 alone. The sheer amount of communication on the subject makes it difficult for a researcher to grasp and structure all the relevant topics and details. Furthermore, pre-defined catalogs and paper classification might not always reflect their content in the most effective way possible.

Based on a set of existing research papers, we will use Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to identify these papers' natural grouping. For each new document that gets into our system, we will use Machine Learning to classify it into one of the previously identified groups. We will use Automated ML (a feature of Azure Machine Learning) to train the best classification model and explain its behavior.

The following diagram highlights the portion of the general architecture covered by this lab.

![Architecture for Lab 1](./../media/Architecture-1.png)

The high-level steps covered in the lab are:

- Explore dashboard of COVID-19 data
- Explore lab scenario
- Run word embedding process on natural language content of research papers
- Explore results of word embedding
- Run clustering of research papers and explore results
- Use the newly found clusters to label the research document and run the Auto ML process to train a classifier
- Run the classifier on "new" research papers
- Explain the best model produced by AutoML

## Task 5 - Train a Machine Learning model with Automated ML

In this task, we'll use Azure Automated ML to train a machine learning model capable of determining the best cluster for a COVID-19 scientific article. It builds upon the work done in the Data Preparation notebook.

1. In the Azure Machine Learning studio, switch to the `Automated ML` **(1)** section and select `+ New Automated ML job` **(2)** to start the Automated ML.

    ![Automated ML section is open. + New Automated ML run button is highlighted.](media/lab1-task5-1.png)

2. In the `Create a new Automated ML run` wizard pick `COVID19Articles_Train_Vectors` **(1)** as your dataset and select `Next` **(2)** to proceed.

    ![COVID19Articles_Train_Vectors dataset is selected. Next button is highlighted.](media/automl-selected-dataset.png)

3. In order to be able to launch an Automated ML run we need to provision a Azure ML compute cluster. On the `Configure run` step select `aml-compute-cpu` **(1)** from the list of clusters. If the list is empty select `+ New` **(2)** link.

    ![Select compute cluster dropdown list and create a new compute link are highlighted.](media/amlcompute-select.png)

    > **Note:** If you already have `aml-compute-cpu` cluster provisioned, feel free to skip to step 6.

4. On the `Create compute cluster` screen set the values listed below:

    - **Virtual machine priority (1)**: Dedicated
    - **Virtual machine type (2)**: CPU
    - **Virtual machine Size (3)**: Standard_DS3_v2

    ![Dedicated virtual machine priority, CPU virtual machine type, and Standard_DS3_v2 virtual machine size are selected. The next button is highlighted.](media/create-new-compute-cluster.png)

    Select `Next` **(4)** to continue.

5. To configure cluster settings set the values given below:

    - **Compute name (1)**: aml-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>
    - **Minimum number od nodes (2)**: 0
    - **Maximum number of nodes (3)**: 4  

    Setting the number of maximum nodes to a higher value will allow Automated ML to run more experiments in parallel but will also increase your costs.

    ![Computer name is set to aml-compute-cpu. The minimum number of nodes is set to zero. The maximum number of nodes is set to four. The create button is highlighted.](media/automl-configure-cluster-settings.png)

    Select `Create` **(4)** to proceed.

6. Set the experiment name to `COVID19_Classification` **(1)** and Target column to `cluster` **(2)**. The values we're trying to predict are in the `cluster` column. Then for compute type, select `Compute cluster` **(3)**. If your Azure ML compute cluster is not yet selected, make sure `aml-compute-cpu` **(4)** is selected as your compute for the experiment. Select `Next` **(5)** to continue.

    ![Experiment name is set to COVID19_Classification. Cluster is selected for the target column. Compute cluster selection points aml-compute-cpu. The next button is highlighted.](media/amlcompute2-select.png)

7. On the `Select task and settings` screen, make sure `Classification` **(1)** is selected (confirm with green check). If it is not selected, then select `View additional configuration settings` **(2)** to open a new panel of settings.

    ![Classification is selected as the machine learning task type for the experiment. The View additional configuration settings link is highlighted. ](media/lab1-task5-3.png)

8. On the `Additional configurations` panel, fill in the values listed below:

    - **Primary metric (1)**: AUC weighted
    - Explore **Exit criterion (2)**
    - **Training job time (hours) (3)**: 0.5
    - **Metric score threshold (4)**: 0.95
    - Explore **Concurrency (5)**
    - **Max concurrent iterations (6)**: 4
  
    ![Primary metric is set to AUC weighted. Training job time is set to 0.25 hours. The validation type is set to k-fold cross validation. The number of cross validations is set to five. Max concurrent iterations is set to four. The save button is highlighted.](media/additonal-config-aml01.png)

    Thanks to the 0.5 hours set for `training job time`, the experiment will stop after 30 minutes to minimize cost. When it comes to `Max concurrent iterations`, Automated ML can try at most four models at the same time, this is also limited by the compute instance's maximum number of nodes.

    Select `Save` **(7)**.
    
9. Now, click on the **Next (1)** button to move on [optional] Validate and test.
 
   ![](media/lab1-task5-2.png)

10. On the `Select the validation and test type`, fill in the values listed below:

    - **Validation type (1)**: k-fold cross validation
    - **Number of cross validations (2)**: 5
    - Leave Default for Test dataset (preview)

    Select `Finish` **(3)** to kick off the Automated ML experiment run. If this is the first time you are launching an experiment run in the Azure Machine Learning workspace, the total experiment time will be longer than the `training job time` we have set. This is because of the time needed to start the Compute Cluster and deploy the container images required to execute.

    ![Validation is selected as the machine learning task type for the experiment. The View additional configuration settings link is highlighted. ](media/validationtype-aml.png)

11. On the following screen, you will see the progress of your experiment run.

12. Now that you understand the process of launching an AutoML run, let's explore in the next task the results of an already completed AutoML run.

>**Note**: We have already executed in this environment an AutoML run that is very similar to the one you've just launched. This allows you to explore AutoML results without having to wait for the completion of the run.

## Task 6 - Explore AutoML results

1. In the Azure Machine Learning Studio, navigate to the **Jobs (1)** section and locate the **COVID19_Classification** experiment **(2)**. Select the experiment name link.

    ![Locate the completed experiment ](media/lab1-task6-1.png)

2. You will navigate to the experiment details page, where you should see the list of experiment runs. Locate the first run **(1)** listed here, which has the status **Completed**. The name of the run can be different in your environment and may not match the below screenshot.

    ![Locate the completed AutoML run](media/locate-completed-run01.png)

3. On the **Run details** page, navigate to the **Models (1)** section. Check the values on the  **AUC weighted** column **(2)**, which is the primary metric selected in the AutoML run configuration. See how the best model was selected; this is the one with the maximum metric value. This is also the model for which the explanation was generated. Select **View explanation (3)**.

    ![Explore the models section of the AutoML run](media/inspect-models02.png)

4. On the **Explanations (1)** section, browse the available explanations **(2)** and investigate the **Model performance (3)** representation.

    ![View explanations](media/view-explanations01.png)

## Task 7 - Generate a Responsible AI dashboard in the studio UI

1. In the Azure Machine Learning Studio, navigate to the registered model youâ€™d like to create Responsible AI insights **Models (1)** section under Assets and locate the **rai_diabetes_decision_model_xxxx (2)**. Select the model available.

   ![Model-Created](media/rai_model.png)

2. In **rai_diabetes_decision_model** page, from the **Details (1)** option click the **Create Responsible AI dashboard (preview) (2)** button.

   ![Responsible AI dashboard](media/rai_dashboard.png)

The wizard is designed to provide an interface to input all the necessary parameters to instantiate your Responsible AI dashboard without having to touch code. The experience takes place entirely in the Azure Machine Learning studio UI with a guided flow and instructional text to help contextualize the variety of choices in which Responsible AI components youâ€™d like to populate your dashboard. The wizard is divided into five steps:

* Datasets
* Modeling task
* Dashboard components
* Component parameters
* Experiment configuration

3. Under **Datasets for training and testing** page, we need to select the train and test dataset that you used when training your model to generate model-debugging insights. Select the datasets as per the below instruction and click on **Next**.

* **Select a dataset for training** : From the dropdown select **COVID19Articles_Train**
* **Select a dataset for testing**  : From the dropdown select  **COVID19Articles_Test**

   ![Selecting Dataset](media/select_dataset1.png)

4. Once we picked the dataset, select the **Regression** modeling type and click **Next**

   ![Modeling_type](media/modelling_type.png)

5. Now we need to select the Dashboard components; the Responsible AI dashboard offers two profiles for recommended sets of tools you can generate:

   * **Model debugging**: Understand and debug erroneous data cohorts in your ML model using Error analysis, Counterfactual what-if examples, and Model explainability
   * **Real life interventions** : Understand and debug erroneous data cohorts in your ML model using Causal analysis

6. Select the **Model Debugging** component and click **Next**

   ![Model Debugging](media/model_debugging.png)
   
7. After selecting a profile, we need to configure parameters for dashboard components. Explore through the component parameters for model debugging
  
     * **Target feature (required)**: Specify the feature that your model was trained to predict
     * **Categorical features**: Indicate which features are categorical to properly render them as categorical values in the dashboard UI. This is pre-loaded for you based on your dataset metadata.
     * **Generate error tree and heat map**: Toggle on and off to generate an error analysis component for your Responsible AI dashboard
     * **Features for error heat map**: Select up to two features to pre-generate an error heatmap.
     * **Advanced configuration**: Specify additional parameters for your error tree, such as Maximum depth, Number of leaves, Minimum number of samples in one leaf.
     * **Generate counterfactual what-if examples**: Toggle on and off to generate counterfactual what-if component for your Responsible AI dashboard
     * **Number of counterfactuals** (required): Specify the number of counterfactual examples you want generated per datapoint. A minimum of at least 10 should be generated to enable a bar chart view in the dashboard of which features were most perturbed on average to achieve the desired prediction.
     * **Range of value predictions (required)**: Specify for regression scenarios the desired range in which you want counterfactual examples to have prediction values. For binary classification scenarios, it will automatically be set to generate counterfactuals for the opposite class of each datapoint. For multi-classification scenarios, there will be a drop-down to specify which class you want each datapoint to be predicted as.
     * **Specify features to perturb**: By default, all features will be perturbed. However, if there are specific features you want perturbed, clicking this will open a panel with the list of features to select. (See below)
     * **Generate explanations**: Toggle on and off to generate a model explanation component for your Responsible AI dashboard. No configuration is necessary as a default opaque box mimic explainer will be used to generate feature importance.
  

8. In **Target feature** select **Column1** and for **Categorial features** select **0,1,2,3,4,5,6** from the dropdown. **Disable** the **Error tree and heat map** option. If enabling the **Counterfactual what-if examples** please ensure to provide _Number of counterfactuals_ and _Range of value predictions_ as shown in the below screenshot. Leave the other parameters to default and select **Next**.


   ![Parameters_debugging](media/lab1-task7-1.png)

9. In the **Training job or experiment configuration**, page enter the following:

   * **Name** : Give the dashboard a unique name so that you can differentiate it when youâ€™re viewing the list of dashboards for a given model.
   * **Experiment name** : Select an existing experiment to run the job.
   * **Existing experiment** : Select an existing experiment from drop-down.
   * **Select compute type** : Compute cluster
   * **Select compute** : cpucluster

10. Skip the creation of experiment by clicking the **Cancel** option, since we have already created an RAI dashboard in the environment, this allows you to explore on Responsible AI Dashboard experiments without having to wait for the completion of the job run.
